#Levelling up your WordPress development workflow

Slides for my talk at [WordCamp Toronto 2014](http://2014.toronto.wordcamp.org)!

You can view my interactive slides online at [http://daraskolnick.github.io/WCTO-dev-workflow](http://daraskolnick.github.io/WCTO-dev-workflow) or a static (and less nice, let's be honest) version on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/daraskolnick/levelling-up-your-wordpress-development-workflow). 

Slides made with the awesomeness of [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/).
